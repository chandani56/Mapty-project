# Mapty-project

Mapty is a workout-tracking web application that uses geolocation and interactive maps to let users log running and cycling workouts directly on a map. It records details like distance, duration, pace, speed, and location, storing all data locally so workouts remain even after a page reload. The project demonstrates OOP in JavaScript, modular code structure, map APIs, and real-world application logic.

Mapty – Workout Tracking Web Application

Mapty is a location-based workout tracking application that allows users to log running and cycling workouts directly on an interactive map. The project uses geolocation and the Leaflet map library to mark workouts on the map, display stats, and store all data locally for persistence.
This project demonstrates advanced JavaScript concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), classes, constructor functions, DOM manipulation, external libraries, and browser APIs.

🚀 Features
✔ 1. Geolocation Detection

Automatically detects your current location to display a map centered on your area.

✔ 2. Interactive Map (Leaflet API)

Users can click anywhere on the map to record a workout.

✔ 3. Add Workouts

Log details for:

Running (distance, time, cadence, pace)

Cycling (distance, time, elevation, speed)

✔ 4. Dynamic UI Updates

Workouts show up in a sidebar with all relevant details.

✔ 5. Persistent Data (LocalStorage)

All workouts are saved and remain even after page reload.

✔ 6. OOP-Based Architecture

The project uses classes and clean code structure for maintainability.

✔ 7. Responsive & Clean UI

Works smoothly across different devices.
